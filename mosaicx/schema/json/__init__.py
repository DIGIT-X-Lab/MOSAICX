Purpose:
--------
House the JSON Schema representations produced during schema generation.  These
files mirror the Python Pydantic modules and provide interoperability for
systems that prefer language-agnostic definitions.

Notes:
------
- Files are created automatically when callers request SchemaSpec exports.
- Directory structure is maintained within the package to simplify packaging
  and distribution on PyPI.
