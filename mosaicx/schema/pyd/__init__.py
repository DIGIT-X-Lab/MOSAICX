Purpose:
--------
Persist auto-generated Pydantic models that describe clinical data schemas.
These modules are imported by the extractor for runtime validation and may be
committed to preserve versioned contracts.

Notes:
------
- Files follow a timestamped naming convention sourced from the schema
  registry to prevent collisions.
- The directory is packaged with the distribution so existing models accompany
  the CLI and API when installed.
