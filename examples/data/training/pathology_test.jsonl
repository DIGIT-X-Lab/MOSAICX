{"report_text": "CLINICAL HISTORY: 52-year-old male with a 4.5 cm mass in the sigmoid colon identified on colonoscopy. Segmental colectomy performed. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received is a segment of sigmoid colon measuring 18 cm in length with attached mesentery. A circumferential, ulcerated, firm mass is identified measuring 4.3 x 3.8 cm, located 5 cm from the distal margin. The mass extends through the bowel wall into the pericolonic fat. Twenty-two lymph nodes are identified in the mesentery. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon. The tumor forms irregular glands with desmoplastic stromal reaction. Invasion through the muscularis propria into the pericolonic adipose tissue is confirmed. Lymphovascular invasion is present. Perineural invasion is present. Three of 22 lymph nodes contain metastatic adenocarcinoma. Proximal and distal resection margins are negative. Tumor budding score is high (10 buds per 0.785 mm2).

{"report_text": "CLINICAL HISTORY: 36-year-old female with a 2.0 cm right ovarian mass found incidentally during cesarean section. Right oophorectomy performed. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received is a right ovary measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm weighing 18 grams. Sectioning reveals a well-circumscribed, solid, yellow mass measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. The remaining ovarian tissue is unremarkable. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections show an adult granulosa cell tumor. The tumor cells are arranged in microfollicular (Call-Exner bodies), trabecular, and diffuse patterns. The cells are uniform with pale nuclei showing characteristic nuclear grooves (coffee-bean appearance). Mitotic activity is low at 2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields. No capsular invasion, hemorrhage, or necrosis is identified. The tumor is confined to the ovary.

The tumor shows a biphasic pattern with epithelial and myoepithelial components set in a chondromyxoid stroma. Epithelial cells form ducts and sheets. The myoepithelial cells are spindled and plasmacytoid. The capsule is intact throughout, although focal thinning is noted. No atypia, necrosis, or invasive growth is identified.
