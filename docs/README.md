# MOSAICX Documentation

Welcome to the MOSAICX documentation. These guides will walk you through everything you need to know — from installation to advanced optimization.

## Guides

| Guide | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Getting Started](getting-started.md) | Install MOSAICX, run your first extraction, understand the basics |
| [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md) | Every command, every flag, with copy-pasteable examples |
| [Pipelines](pipelines.md) | What each pipeline does, inputs/outputs, JSONL formats |
| [Schemas and Templates](schemas-and-templates.md) | Create, manage, and use extraction schemas and YAML templates |
| [Optimization and Evaluation](optimization.md) | Improve accuracy with labeled data using DSPy optimizers |
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | Environment variables, LLM backends, OCR engines, export formats |
| [MCP Server](mcp-server.md) | Use MOSAICX as an AI agent tool via Model Context Protocol |
| [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md) | Create custom pipelines, Python SDK, extend MOSAICX |
| [SDK Reference](sdk-reference.md) | Complete Python API -- function signatures, examples, input/output matrix |
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | System design, pipeline patterns, key design decisions |

## Where to Start

**First time?** Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md). It walks you through installation and your first extraction in under 10 minutes.

**Know the basics?** Jump to the guide that matches what you're trying to do:

- **"I want to extract data from a document"** -- [Getting Started](getting-started.md), then [Pipelines](pipelines.md)
- **"I want to define exactly what fields to extract"** -- [Schemas and Templates](schemas-and-templates.md)
- **"I want to improve extraction accuracy"** -- [Optimization and Evaluation](optimization.md)
- **"I want to connect to a different LLM backend"** -- [Configuration](configuration.md)
- **"I need the exact flags for a command"** -- [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md)
- **"I want to use MOSAICX from Python code"** -- [SDK Reference](sdk-reference.md)
- **"I want to let AI agents use MOSAICX"** -- [MCP Server](mcp-server.md)
- **"I want to build a new pipeline"** -- [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md), then [Architecture](architecture.md)
